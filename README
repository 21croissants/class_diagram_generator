== Credits:

Much inspired from railsroad () and yumlrails ()
also some code form http://github.com/glejeune/ruby-yuml

== plugin code written on rails!

With a flappy internet connection or no internet connection at all

I started hacking around with these tools but without tests, I could not go very far and hit such a wall of frustration that
I starting my own, using a BDD approach with RSpec. 


This plugin has been almost entirely written on Rails ;-)
I mean I wrote 80% of the code in the train! I do a lot of travel at the moment as I work for a company
in Berlin and I live in Lyon: that is exacly 12 hours door to door.
